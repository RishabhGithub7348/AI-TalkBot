# AI-TalkBot
AI Voice Chatbot is a web application that allows users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot using voice commands. The application records the user's voice, transcribes it using Google's Cloud Speech-to-Text API, sends the transcription to a backend server that uses an AI model to generate a response, and then plays the response using Google's Cloud Text-to-Speech API. The application also allows users to store their chat data on the Filecoin blockchain.
